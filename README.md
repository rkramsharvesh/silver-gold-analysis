# **Is Silver Still Just Gold’s Shadow? — Analysis Repository**

This repository contains the full code and data workflow behind my research article:

**“Is Silver Still Just Gold’s Shadow? A 20-Year Story of Industrial Demand, Tightening Supply, and What Comes Next.”**

The analysis explores how silver’s role in global markets has evolved over the last two decades — particularly the rising dominance of **industrial demand**, persistent **physical deficits**, and the slow, uneven process of silver decoupling from gold-driven price behavior.

The statistical work includes:

* **Descriptive analysis** of demand composition and supply deficits
* **MIDAS regressions** to test whether short-term industrial fundamentals influence silver prices
* **Toda–Yamamoto causality tests** for mixed-integrated financial & industrial time series
* **Structural break detection** to identify regime shifts in the silver market
* Visualization of long-term trends in solar demand, industrial use, supply deficits, and the gold–silver ratio

These methods help answer a core question:
**Is silver starting to behave like an industrial metal rather than just gold’s volatile cousin?**

## **Summary of Findings**

Silver still reacts to gold in the short term — but the market underneath is changing.

Key takeaways include (from the report ):

* Industrial demand accounts for **~67%** of total silver usage.
* **Solar demand** has grown more than **7,000%** since early 2000s.
* The market has been in **large and repeated physical deficits**, some over **200 million ounces**.
* Short-term pricing still ignores fundamentals (MIDAS shows little sensitivity).
* Longer-term tests (Toda–Yamamoto) show **emerging predictive influence** from industrial demand.
* Structural breaks in **2008**, **2013**, and **2023** suggest regime transitions aligned with macro shifts and solar growth.
